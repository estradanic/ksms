# ksms
# A Simple SMS Frontend for kdeconnect

# Dependencies
- kdeconnect
- Qt version 5.9 or higher (if anyone wants to help build for lower versions, that would be appreciated. I can't get it to work.)

# Installation
- hopefully the deb file works. Let me know if it doesn't. I'm very new at deployment and I'm figuring things out very slowly.
- Or you can open up the project in Qt Creator and build it that way.
